MTBCI 2013
=================

With this little script we can see each others commits on the big screen!

Adding your repo
--------
Just fork this repo, add you repo to the array on line #55 in index.html and give me a pull request!

Todo
--------
Here are some more ideas to make this even better:

- Add hrefs to titles
- Connect with NODE.js to have smoother updates
- Add the Countdown timer
- Show user statistics (e.g.: # of commits)

Feel free to work on any of these or add your own to this list.

Just fork and send me pul requests and I will keep everything up to date!
